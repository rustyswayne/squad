# Migration Checklist: squad-pr → squad (v0.6.0-preview)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Do not execute ANY steps until Brady says "banana"**

Print this page and check off as you proceed.

---

## BANANA GATE
- [ ] **Brady explicitly said: "banana"**

If this is NOT checked, STOP. Do not proceed.

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites & Environment

- [ ] Both repos cloned: `C:\src\squad-pr` and `C:\src\squad`
- [ ] Squad-pr: `git status` shows clean tree
- [ ] Squad (public): `git status` shows clean tree
- [ ] GitHub CLI authenticated: `gh auth status` ✅
- [ ] Both repos accessible: `gh repo view bradygaster/squad-pr` ✅
- [ ] Node.js ≥20: `node --version` shows 20.x+
- [ ] npm ≥10: `npm --version` ✅

---

## Phase 2: Security Scan

- [ ] No `.env` files in git: `git ls-files | grep "\.env"` (empty)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets: Scanned for token, password, key, secret patterns
- [ ] Scanned .copilot/ for sensitive content — safe
- [ ] No Authorization headers in source code
- [ ] **Result: PASS** (or STOP if secrets found — use BFG)

---

## Phase 3: Version Preparation (squad-pr)

- [ ] Updated `package.json` version → 0.6.0-preview
- [ ] Updated `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` version → 0.6.0-preview
- [ ] Updated `packages/squad-cli/package.json` version → 0.6.0-preview
- [ ] Ran `npm install --package-lock-only`
- [ ] Build passes: `npm run build` (exit code 0)
- [ ] Tests pass: `npm test` (all pass)
- [ ] Commit created: "chore: version bump to 0.6.0-preview for public migration"

---

## Phase 4: Breaking Changes & Beta User Migration

- [ ] Documented breaking changes between v0.5.x and v0.6.0-preview:
  - [ ] TypeScript rewrite of entire codebase
  - [ ] New .squad/ directory format (v0.5.4 format incompatible)
  - [ ] Command structure reorganization
  - [ ] SDK API changes for programmatic integration
- [ ] Created beta user upgrade guide section in `docs/migration-guide-private-to-public.md`
- [ ] Documented two distribution channels (GitHub-native vs npm)
- [ ] Explained automatic upgrade path: `npx github:bradygaster/squad` → v0.6.0-preview after migration
- [ ] Documented recommended migration path to npm for version management
- [ ] Added .squad/ directory migration procedure (v0.5.4 → v0.6.0 format)
- [ ] Documented shell script/CI updates needed (GitHub-native → npm)

---

## Phase 5: Test npx github: Distribution

- [ ] After migration is complete, test GitHub-native distribution:
  - [ ] Temporary directory: `mkdir $HOME\squad-test-github-native`
  - [ ] Install via GitHub-native: `npx github:bradygaster/squad@latest --version`
  - [ ] Expected output: v0.6.0-preview (or newer)
  - [ ] Verify: `npx github:bradygaster/squad@latest doctor` passes
  - [ ] Cleanup: `rm -Recurse -Force $HOME\squad-test-github-native`
- [ ] Confirm that `npx github:bradygaster/squad` (no @) auto-gets latest commit after migration

---

## Phase 6: Repository Reference Sweep (squad-pr → squad)

- [ ] Searched all files for squad-pr references: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.ts,*.tsx,*.md,*.json,*.yml,*.yaml -File | Select-String -Pattern "squad-pr"`
- [ ] Reviewed search results and captured in CSV
- [ ] Replaced all package.json `@bradygaster/squad-pr` → `@bradygaster/squad`
- [ ] Replaced all GitHub URLs: `github.com/bradygaster/squad-pr` → `github.com/bradygaster/squad`
- [ ] Replaced repository fields in package.json files
- [ ] Updated README.md links and references
- [ ] Updated CONTRIBUTING.md links
- [ ] Updated all docs/*.md files
- [ ] Updated .github/workflows/*.yml references
- [ ] Updated product title/header strings in CLI
- [ ] Updated .squad/team.md repository references
- [ ] Verified zero remaining squad-pr references: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.ts,*.tsx,*.md,*.json,*.yml,*.yaml -File | Select-String -Pattern "squad-pr" | Measure-Object` returned 0
- [ ] Commit created: "chore: sweep repository references squad-pr → squad"

---
