### Auto-link detection for preview builds
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-28
**What:** When running from source (`VERSION` contains `-preview`), the CLI checks if `@bradygaster/squad-cli` is globally npm-linked. If not, it prompts the developer to link it. Declining creates `~/.squad/.no-auto-link` to suppress future prompts.
**Why:** Dev convenience — saves contributors from forgetting `npm link` after cloning. Non-interactive commands (help, version, export, import, doctor, scrub-emails) skip the check. Everything is wrapped in try/catch so failures are silent.
**Impact:** Only affects `-preview` builds in interactive TTY sessions. No effect on published releases or CI.
