### ShellApi.clearMessages() for terminal state reset
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** `ShellApi` now exposes `clearMessages()` which resets both `messages` and `archivedMessages` React state. Used in session restore and `/clear` command.
**Why:** Without clearing archived messages, old content bleeds through when restoring sessions or clearing the shell. The `/clear` command previously only reset `messages`, leaving `archivedMessages` in the Static render list.
**Impact:** Any code calling `shellApi` to reset shell state should use `clearMessages()` rather than manually manipulating message arrays.
