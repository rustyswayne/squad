# Decisions

> Team decisions that all agents must respect. Managed by Scribe.

### 2026-02-21: Type safety — strict mode non-negotiable
**By:** Edie (carried from beta)
**What:** `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, no `@ts-ignore` allowed.
**Why:** Types are contracts. If it compiles, it works. Strict mode catches entire categories of bugs.

### 2026-02-21: Hook-based governance over prompt instructions
**By:** Baer (carried from beta)
**What:** Security, PII, and file-write guards are implemented via the hooks module, NOT prompt instructions.
**Why:** Prompts can be ignored or overridden. Hooks are code — they execute deterministically.

### 2026-02-21: Node.js >=20, ESM-only, streaming-first
**By:** Fortier (carried from beta)
**What:** Runtime target is Node.js 20+. ESM-only (no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards). Async iterators over buffers.
**Why:** Modern Node.js features enable cleaner async patterns. ESM-only eliminates CJS interop complexity.

### 2026-02-21: Casting — The Usual Suspects, permanent
**By:** Squad Coordinator (carried from beta)
**What:** Team names drawn from The Usual Suspects (1995). Scribe is always Scribe. Ralph is always Ralph. Names persist across repos and replatforms.
**Why:** Names are team identity. The team rebuilt Squad beta with these names.

### 2026-02-21: Proposal-first workflow
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Meaningful changes require a proposal in `docs/proposals/` before execution.
**Why:** Proposals create alignment before code is written. Cheaper to change a doc than refactor code.

### 2026-02-21: Tone ceiling — always enforced
**By:** McManus (carried from beta)
**What:** No hype, no hand-waving, no claims without citations. Every public-facing statement must be substantiated.
**Why:** Trust is earned through accuracy, not enthusiasm.

### 2026-02-21: Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved
**By:** Rabin (carried from beta)
**What:** CLI remains thin (`cli.js`), runtime stays modular. Zero runtime dependencies for the CLI scaffolding path.
**Why:** Users should be able to run `npx` without downloading a dependency tree.

### 2026-02-21: Merge driver for append-only files
**By:** Kobayashi (carried from beta)
**What:** `.gitattributes` uses `merge=union` for `.squad/decisions.md`, `agents/*/history.md`, `log/**`, `orchestration-log/**`.
**Why:** Enables conflict-free merging of team state across branches. Both sides only append content.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — Interactive Shell as Primary UX
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad becomes its own interactive CLI shell. `squad` with no args enters a REPL where users talk directly to the team. Copilot SDK is the LLM backend.
**Why:** Squad needs to own the full interactive experience with real-time status and direct coordination UX.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — no temp/memory files in repo root
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** NEVER write temp files, issue files, or memory files to the repo root. All squad state/scratch files belong in .squad/ and ONLY .squad/. Root tree of a user's repo is sacred.
**Why:** User request — hard rule. Captured for all agents.

### 2026-02-21: npm workspace protocol for monorepo
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** Use npm-native workspace resolution (version-string references) instead of `workspace:*` protocol for cross-package dependencies.
**Why:** The `workspace:*` protocol is pnpm/Yarn-specific. npm workspaces resolve workspace packages automatically.
**Impact:** All inter-package dependencies in `packages/*/package.json` should use the actual version string, not `workspace:*`.

### 2026-02-21: Distribution is npm-only (GitHub-native removed)
**By:** Rabin (Distribution) + Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** Squad packages (`@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli`) are distributed exclusively via npmjs.com. The GitHub-native `npx github:bradygaster/squad` path has been removed.
**Why:** npm is the standard distribution channel. One distribution path reduces confusion and maintenance burden. Root `cli.js` prints deprecation warning if anyone still hits the old path.

### 2026-02-21: Coordinator prompt structure — three routing modes
**By:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)
**What:** Coordinator uses structured response format: `DIRECT:` (answer inline), `ROUTE:` + `TASK:` + `CONTEXT:` (single agent), `MULTI:` (fan-out). Unrecognized formats fall back to `DIRECT`.
**Why:** Keyword prefixes are cheap to parse and reliable. Fallback-to-direct prevents silent failures.

### 2026-02-21: CLI entry point split — src/index.ts is a pure barrel
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** `src/index.ts` is a pure re-export barrel with ZERO side effects. `src/cli-entry.ts` contains `main()` and all CLI routing.
**Why:** Library consumers importing `@bradygaster/squad` were triggering CLI argument parsing and `process.exit()` on import.

### 2026-02-21: Process.exit() refactor — library-safe CLI functions
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**What:** `fatal()` throws `SquadError` instead of `process.exit(1)`. Only `cli-entry.ts` may call `process.exit()`.
**Pattern:** Library functions throw `SquadError`. CLI entry catches and exits. Library consumers catch for structured error handling.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — docs as you go
**By:** bradygaster (via Copilot)
**What:** Doc and blog as you go during SquadUI integration work. Doesn't have to be perfect — keep docs updated incrementally.

### 2026-02-22: Runtime EventBus as canonical bus
**By:** Fortier
**What:** `runtime/event-bus.ts` (colon-notation: `session:created`, `subscribe()` API) is the canonical EventBus for all orchestration classes. The `client/event-bus.ts` (dot-notation) remains for backward-compat but should not be used in new code.
**Why:** Runtime EventBus has proper error isolation — one handler failure doesn't crash others.

### 2026-02-22: Subpath exports in @bradygaster/squad-sdk
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** SDK declares subpath exports (`.`, `./parsers`, `./types`, and module paths). Each uses types-first condition ordering.
**Constraints:** Every subpath needs a source barrel. `"types"` before `"import"`. ESM-only: no `"require"` condition.

### 2026-02-22: User directive — Aspire testing requirements
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Integration tests must launch the Aspire dashboard and validate OTel telemetry shows up. Use Playwright. Use latest Aspire bits. Reference aspire.dev (NOT learn.microsoft.com). It's "Aspire" not ".NET Aspire".

### 2026-02-23: User directive — code fences
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Never use / or \ as code fences in GitHub issues, PRs, or comments. Only use backticks to format code.

### 2026-02-23: User Directive — Docs Overhaul & Publication Pause
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Pause docs publication until Brady explicitly gives go-ahead. Tone: lighthearted, welcoming, fun (NOT stuffy). First doc should be "first experience" with squad CLI. All docs: brief, prompt-first, action-oriented, fun. Human tone throughout.

### 2026-02-23: Use sendAndWait for streaming dispatch
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** `dispatchToAgent()` and `dispatchToCoordinator()` use `sendAndWait()` instead of `sendMessage()`. Fallback listens for `turn_end`/`idle` if unavailable.
**Why:** `sendMessage()` is fire-and-forget — resolves before streaming deltas arrive.
**Impact:** Never parse `accumulated` after a bare `sendMessage()`. Always use `awaitStreamedResponse`.

### 2026-02-23: extractDelta field priority — deltaContent first
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** `extractDelta` priority: `deltaContent` > `delta` > `content`. Matches SDK actual format.
**Impact:** Use `deltaContent` as the canonical field name for streamed text chunks.

### 2026-02-24: Per-command --help/-h: intercept-before-dispatch pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** All CLI subcommands support `--help` and `-h`. Help intercepted before command routing prevents destructive commands from executing.
**Convention:** New CLI commands MUST have a `getCommandHelp()` entry with usage, description, options, and 2+ examples.

### 2026-02-25: REPL cancellation and configurable timeout
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** Ctrl+C immediately resets `processing` state. Timeout: `SQUAD_REPL_TIMEOUT` (seconds) > `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` (ms) > 600000ms default. CLI `--timeout` flag sets env var.

### 2026-02-24: Shell Observability Metrics
**By:** Saul (Aspire & Observability)
**What:** Four metrics under `squad.shell.*` namespace, gated behind `SQUAD_TELEMETRY=1`.
**Convention:** Shell metrics require explicit consent via `SQUAD_TELEMETRY=1`, separate from OTLP endpoint activation.

### 2026-02-23: Telemetry in both CLI and agent modes
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad should pump telemetry during BOTH modes: (1) standalone Squad CLI, and (2) running as an agent inside GitHub Copilot CLI.

### 2026-02-27: ASCII-only separators and NO_COLOR
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**What:** All separators use ASCII hyphens. Text-over-emoji principle: text status is primary, emoji is supplementary.
**Convention:** Use ASCII hyphens for separators. Keep emoji out of status/system messages.

### 2026-02-24: Version format — bare semver canonical
**By:** Fenster
**What:** Bare semver (e.g., `0.8.5.1`) for version commands. Display contexts use `squad v{VERSION}`.

### 2026-02-25: Help text — progressive disclosure
**By:** Fenster
**What:** Default `/help` shows 4 essential lines. `/help full` shows complete reference.

### 2026-02-24: Unified status vocabulary
**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)
**What:** Use `[WORK]` / `[STREAM]` / `[ERR]` / `[IDLE]` across ALL status surfaces.
**Why:** Most granular, NO_COLOR compatible, text-over-emoji, consistent across contexts.

### 2026-02-24: Pick one tagline
**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)
**What:** Use "Team of AI agents at your fingertips" everywhere.

### 2026-02-24: User directive — experimental messaging
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** CLI docs should note the project is experimental and ask users to file issues.

### 2026-02-28: User directive — DO NOT merge PR #547
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** DO NOT merge PR #547 (Squad Remote Control). Do not touch #547 at all.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-28: CLI Critical Gap Issues Filed
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** 4 critical CLI gaps filed as GitHub issues #554–#557 for explicit team tracking:
- #554: `--preview` flag undocumented and untested
- #556: `--timeout` flag undocumented and untested
- #557: `upgrade --self` is dead code
- #555: `run` subcommand is a stub (non-functional)

**Why:** Orchestration logs captured gaps but they lacked actionable GitHub tracking and ownership. Filed issues now have explicit assignment to Fenster, clear acceptance criteria, and visibility in Wave E planning.

### 2026-02-28: Test Gap Issues Filed (10 items)
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**What:** 10 moderate CLI/test gaps filed as issues #558–#567:
- #558: Exit code consistency untested
- #559: Timeout edge cases untested
- #560: Missing per-command help
- #561: Shell-specific flag behavior untested
- #562: Env var fallback paths untested
- #563: REPL mode transitions untested
- #564: Config file precedence untested
- #565: Agent spawn flags undocumented
- #566: Untested flag aliases
- #567: Flag parsing error handling untested

**Why:** Each gap identified in coverage analysis but lacked explicit GitHub tracking for prioritization and team visibility.

### 2026-02-28: Documentation Audit Results (10 issues)
**By:** McManus (DevRel)
**What:** Docs audit filed 10 GitHub issues (#568–#575, #577–#578) spanning:
- Feature documentation lag (#568 `squad run`, #570 consult mode, #572 Ralph smart triage)
- Terminology inconsistency (#569 triage/watch/loop naming)
- Brand compliance (#571 experimental banner on 40+ docs)
- Clarity/UX gaps (#573 response modes, #575 dual-root, #577 VS Code, #578 session examples)
- Reference issue (#574 README command count)

**Why:** Features shipped faster than documentation. PR #552, #553 merged without doc updates. No automation to enforce experimental banner. Users discover advanced features accidentally.

**Root cause:** Feature-docs lag, decision-doc drift, no brand enforcement in CI.

### 2026-02-28: Dogfood UX Issues Filed (4 items)
**By:** Waingro (Dogfooder)
**What:** Dogfood testing against 8 realistic scenarios surfaced 4 UX issues (filed as #576, #579–#581):
- #576 (P1): Shell launch fails in non-TTY piped mode (Blocks CI)
- #580 (P1): Help text overwhelms new users (44 lines, no tiering)
- #579 (P2): Status shows parent `.squad/` as local (confusing in multi-project workspaces)
- #581 (P2): Error messages show debug output always (noisy production logs)

**Why:** CLI is solid for happy path but first-time user experience and CI/CD integration have friction points. All 4 block either new user onboarding or automation workflows.

**Priority:** #576 > #580 > #581 > #579. All should be fixed before next public release.

### 2026-02-28: decisions.md Aggressive Cleanup
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** Trimmed `decisions.md` from 226KB (223 entries) to 10.3KB (35 entries) — 95% reduction.
- Kept: Core architectural decisions, active process rules, active user directives, current UX conventions, runtime patterns
- Archived: Implementation details, one-time setup, PR reviews, audit reports, wave planning, superseded decisions, duplicates
- Created: `decisions-archive.md` with full original content preserved

**Why:** Context window bloat during release push. Every agent loads 95% less decisions context. Full history preserved append-only.

**Impact:** File size reduced, agent context efficiency improved, all decisions preserved in archive.

### 2026-02-28: Backlog Gap Issues Filed (8 items)
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Approval:** Brady (via directive in issue request)
**What:** Filed 8 missing backlog items from `.squad/identity/now.md` as GitHub issues. These items were identified as "should-fix" polish or "post-M1" improvements but lacked explicit GitHub tracking until now.

**Why:** Brady requested: "Cross-reference the known backlog against filed issues and file anything missing." The team had filed 28 issues this session (#554–#581), but 8 known items from `now.md` remained unfiled. Without GitHub issues, these lack ownership assignment, visibility for Wave E planning, trackability in automated workflows, and routing to squad members.

**Issues Filed:**
- #583 (squad:rabin): Add `homepage` and `bugs` fields to package.json
- #584 (squad:mcmanus): Document alpha→v1.0 breaking change policy in README
- #585 (squad:edie): Add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to tsconfig
- #586 (squad:edie): Tighten ~26 `any` types in SDK
- #587 (squad:mcmanus): Add architecture overview doc
- #588 (squad:kujan): Implement SQUAD_DEBUG env var test
- #589 (squad:kujan): One real Copilot SDK integration test
- #590 (squad:baer): `npm audit fix` for dev-dependency ReDoS warnings
- #591 (squad:hockney, type:bug): Aspire dashboard test fails — docker pull in test suite
- #592 (squad:rabin): Replace workspace:* protocol with version string

**Impact:** Full backlog now visible with explicit issues. No unmapped items. Each issue routed to the squad member domain expert. Issues are independent; can be executed in any order.

### 2026-02-28: Codebase Scan — Unfiled Issues Audit
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Requested by:** Brady
**Date:** 2026-02-28T22:05:00Z
**Status:** Complete — 2 new issues filed

**What:** Systematic scan of the codebase to identify known issues that haven't been filed as GitHub issues. Checked:
1. TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments in code
2. TypeScript strict mode violations (@ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error)
3. Skipped/todo tests (.skip() or .todo())
4. Errant console.log statements
5. Missing package.json metadata fields

**Findings:**
- Type safety violations: ✅ CLEAN — Zero @ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error found. Strict mode compliance excellent.
- Workspace protocol: ❌ VIOLATION — 1 issue filed (#592): `workspace:*` in squad-cli violates npm workspace convention
- Skipped tests: ❌ GAP — 1 issue filed (#588): SQUAD_DEBUG test is .todo() placeholder
- Console.log: ✅ INTENTIONAL — All are user-facing output (status, errors)
- TODO comments: ✅ TEMPLATES — TODOs in generated workflow templates, not code
- Package.json: ✅ TRACKED — Missing homepage/bugs already filed as #583

**Code Quality Assessment:**
- Type Safety (Excellent): Zero violations of strict mode or type suppression. Team decision being followed faithfully.
- TODO/FIXME Comments (Clean): All TODOs in upgrade.ts and workflows.ts are template strings for generated GitHub Actions YAML, intentionally scoped.
- Console Output (Intentional): All are user-facing (dashboard startup, OTLP endpoint, issue labeling, shell loading) — no debug debris.
- Dead Code (None Found): No unreachable code, orphaned functions, or unused exports detected.

**Recommendations:**
1. Immediate: Fix workspace protocol violation (#592) — violates established team convention
2. Soon: Implement SQUAD_DEBUG test (#588) — fills observable test gap
3. Going forward: Maintain type discipline; review package.json metadata during SDK/CLI version bumps

**Conclusion:** Codebase in good health. Type safety discipline strong. No hidden technical debt. Conventions mostly followed (one npm workspace exception). Test coverage has minor gaps in observability.

### 2026-02-28: Auto-link detection for preview builds
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-28
**What:** When running from source (`VERSION` contains `-preview`), the CLI checks if `@bradygaster/squad-cli` is globally npm-linked. If not, it prompts the developer to link it. Declining creates `~/.squad/.no-auto-link` to suppress future prompts.
**Why:** Dev convenience — saves contributors from forgetting `npm link` after cloning. Non-interactive commands (help, version, export, import, doctor, scrub-emails) skip the check. Everything is wrapped in try/catch so failures are silent.
**Impact:** Only affects `-preview` builds in interactive TTY sessions. No effect on published releases or CI.

### 2026-03-01T00:34Z: User directive — Full scrollback support in REPL shell
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** The REPL shell must support full scrollback — users should be able to scroll up and down to see all text (paste, run output, rendered content, logs) over time, like GitHub Copilot CLI does. The current Ink-based rendering loses/hides content and that's unacceptable.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. This is a P0 UX requirement for the shell.
**Status:** P0 blocking issue. Requires rendering architecture review (Cheritto, Kovash, Marquez).

### 2026-03-01T04:47Z: User directive — Auto-incrementing build numbers
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Add auto-incrementing build numbers to versions. Format: `0.8.6.{N}-preview` where N increments each local build. Tracks build-to-release cadence.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory.

### 2026-03-01: Nap engine — dual sync/async export pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** The nap engine (`cli/core/nap.ts`) exports both `runNap` (async, for CLI entry) and `runNapSync` (sync, for REPL). All internal operations use sync fs calls. The async wrapper exists for CLI convention consistency.
**Why:** REPL `executeCommand` is synchronous and cannot await. ESM forbids `require()`. Exporting a sync variant keeps the REPL integration clean without changing the shell architecture.
**Impact:** Future commands that need both CLI and REPL support should follow this pattern if they only do sync fs work.

### 2026-03-01: First-run gating test strategy
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #607
**What:** Created `test/first-run-gating.test.ts` with 25 tests covering 6 categories of Init Mode gating. Tests use logic-level extraction from App.tsx conditionals, filesystem marker lifecycle via `loadWelcomeData`, and source-code structural assertions for render ordering. No full App component rendering — SDK dependencies make that impractical for unit tests.
**Why:** 3059 tests existed with zero enforcement of first-run gating behavior. The `.first-run` marker, banner uniqueness, assembled-message gating, warning suppression, session-scoped keys, and terminal clear ordering were all untested paths that could regress silently.
**Impact:** All squad members: if you modify `loadWelcomeData`, the `firstRunElement` conditional in App.tsx, or the terminal clear sequence in `runShell`, these tests will catch regressions. The warning suppression tests replicate the `cli-entry.ts` pattern — if that pattern changes, update both locations.

### Verbal's Analysis: "nap" Skill — Context Window Optimization
**By:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)
**Requested by:** Brady
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Scope:** Approved. Build it. Current context budget analysis:
- Agent spawn loads charter (~500t) + history + decisions.md (4,852t) + team.md (972t)
- Hockney: 25,940t history (worst offender)
- Fenster: 22,574t (history + CLI inventory)
- Coherence cliff: 40-50K tokens on non-task context

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Decision distillation:** Keep decisions.md as single source of truth (don't embed in charters — creates staleness/duplication)
2. **History compression — 12KB rule insufficient:** Six agents blow past threshold. Target **4KB ceiling per history** (~1,000t) with assertions not stories.
3. **Nap should optimize:** Deduplication (strip decisions.md content echoed in histories), staleness (flag closed PRs, merged work), charter bloat (stay <600t), skill pruning (archive high-confidence, no-recent-invocation skills), demand-loading for extra files (CLI inventory, UX catalog, fragility catalog).
4. **Enforcement:** Nap runs periodically or on-demand, enforces hard ceilings without silent quality degradation.

### ShellApi.clearMessages() for terminal state reset
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** `ShellApi` now exposes `clearMessages()` which resets both `messages` and `archivedMessages` React state. Used in session restore and `/clear` command.
**Why:** Without clearing archived messages, old content bleeds through when restoring sessions or clearing the shell. The `/clear` command previously only reset `messages`, leaving `archivedMessages` in the Static render list.
**Impact:** Any code calling `shellApi` to reset shell state should use `clearMessages()` rather than manually manipulating message arrays.

### 2026-03-01: Prompt placeholder hints must not duplicate header banner
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #606
**What:** The InputPrompt placeholder text must provide *complementary* guidance, never repeat what the header banner already shows. The header banner is the single source of truth for @agent routing and /help discovery. Placeholder hints should surface lesser-known features (tab completion, history navigation, utility commands).
**Why:** Two elements showing "Type @agent or /help" simultaneously creates visual noise and a confusing UX. One consistent prompt style throughout the session.
**Impact:** `getHintText()` in InputPrompt.tsx now has two tiers instead of three. Any future prompt hints should check the header banner first to avoid duplication.

### 2026-03-02: Paste detection via debounce in InputPrompt
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**What:** InputPrompt uses a 10ms debounce on `key.return` to distinguish paste from intentional Enter. If more input arrives within 10ms → paste detected → newline preserved. If timer fires without input → real Enter → submit. A `valueRef` (React ref) mirrors mutations synchronously since closure-captured `value` is stale during rapid `useInput` calls. In disabled state, `key.return` appends `\n` to buffer instead of being ignored.
**Why:** Multi-line paste was garbled because `useInput` fires per-character and `key.return` triggered immediate submission.
**Impact:** 10ms delay on single-line submit is imperceptible. UX: multi-line paste preserved. Testing: Hockney should verify paste scenarios use `jest.useFakeTimers()` or equivalent. Future: if Ink adds native bracketed-paste support, debounce can be replaced.

### 2026-03-01: First-run init messaging — single source of truth
**By:** Kovash (REPL & Interactive Shell)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #625
**What:** When no roster exists, only the header banner tells the user about `squad init` / `/init`. The `firstRunElement` block returns `null` for the empty-roster case instead of showing a duplicate message. `firstRunElement` is reserved for the "Your squad is assembled" onboarding when a roster already exists.
**Why:** Two competing UI elements both said "run squad init" — visual noise that confuses the information hierarchy. Banner is persistent and visible; it owns the no-roster guidance. `firstRunElement` owns the roster-present first-run experience.
**Impact:** App.tsx only. No API or prop changes. Banner text reworded to prioritize `/init` (in-shell path) over exit-and-run.

### 2026-03-01: NODE_NO_WARNINGS for subprocess warning suppression
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #624
**What:** `process.env.NODE_NO_WARNINGS = '1'` is set as the first executable line in `cli-entry.ts` (line 2, after shebang). This supplements the existing `process.emitWarning` override.
**Why:** The Copilot SDK spawns child processes that inherit environment variables but NOT in-process monkey-patches like `process.emitWarning` overrides. `NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1` is the Node.js-native mechanism for suppressing warnings across an entire process tree. Without it, `ExperimentalWarning` messages (e.g., SQLite) leak into the terminal via the SDK's subprocess stderr forwarding.
**Pattern:** When suppressing Node.js warnings, use BOTH: (1) `process.env.NODE_NO_WARNINGS = '1'` — covers child processes (env var inheritance); (2) `process.emitWarning` override — covers main process (belt-and-suspenders).
**Impact:** Eliminates `ExperimentalWarning` noise in terminal for all Squad CLI users, including when the Copilot SDK spawns subprocesses.

### 2026-03-01: No content suppression based on terminal width
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** Terminal width tiers (compact ≤60, standard, wide ≥100) may adjust *layout* (e.g., wrapping, column arrangement) but must NOT suppress or truncate *content*. Every piece of information shown at 120 columns must also be shown at 40 columns.
**Why:** Users can scroll. Hiding roster names, spacing, help text, or routing hints on narrow terminals removes information the user needs. Layout adapts to width; content does not.
**Convention:** `compact` variable may be used for layout decisions (flex direction, column vs. row) but must NOT gate visibility of text, spacing, or UI sections. `wide` may add supplementary content but narrow must not remove it.

### 2026-03-01: Multi-line user message rendering pattern
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** Multi-line user messages in the Static scrollback use `split('\n')` with a column layout: first line gets the `❯` prefix, subsequent lines get `paddingLeft={2}` for alignment.
**Why:** Ink's horizontal `<Box>` layout doesn't handle embedded `\n` in `<Text>` children predictably when siblings exist. Explicit line splitting with column flex direction gives deterministic multi-line rendering.
**Impact:** Any future changes to user message prefix width must update the `paddingLeft={2}` on continuation lines to match.

### 2026-03-01: Elapsed time display — inline after message content
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #605
**What:** Elapsed time annotations on completed agent messages are always rendered inline after the message content as `(X.Xs)` in dimColor. This applies to the Static scrollback block in App.tsx, which is the canonical render path for all completed messages.
**Why:** After the Static scrollback refactor, MessageStream receives `messages=[]` and only renders live streaming content. The duration code in MessageStream was dead. Moving duration display into the Static block ensures it always appears consistently.
**Convention:** `formatDuration()` from MessageStream.tsx is the shared formatter. Format is `Xms` for <1s, `X.Xs` for ≥1s. Always inline, always dimColor, always after content text.

### 2026-03-01: Banner usage line separator convention
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** Banner hint/usage lines use middle dot `·` as inline separator. Init messages use single CTA (no dual-path instructions).
**Why:** Consistent visual rhythm. Middle dot is lighter than em-dash or hyphen for inline command lists. Single CTA reduces cognitive load for new users.
**Impact:** App.tsx headerElement. Future banner copy should follow same separator and single-CTA pattern.

### 2026-03-02: REPL casting engine design
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Status:** Implemented
**Issue:** #638
**What:** Created `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/cast.ts` as a self-contained casting engine with four exports:
1. `parseCastResponse()` — parses the `INIT_TEAM:` format from coordinator output
2. `createTeam()` — scaffolds all `.squad/agents/` directories, writes charters, updates team.md and routing.md, writes casting state JSON
3. `roleToEmoji()` — maps role strings to emoji, reusable across the CLI
4. `formatCastSummary()` — renders a padded roster summary for terminal display

Scribe and Ralph are always injected if missing from the proposal. Casting state is written to `.squad/casting/` (registry.json, history.json, policy.json).
**Why:** Enables coordinator to propose and create teams from within the REPL session after `squad init`.
**Implications:**

### 2026-02-28: Init flow reliability — proposal-first before code

**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Date:** 2026-02-28
**What:** Init/onboarding fixes require a proposal review before implementation. Proposal at `docs/proposals/reliable-init-flow.md`. Two confirmed bugs (race condition in auto-cast, Ctrl+C doesn't abort init session) plus UX gaps (empty-roster messaging, `/init` no-op). P0 bugs are surgical — don't expand scope.
**Why:** Four PRs (#637–#640) patched init iteratively without a unified design. Before writing more patches, the team needs to agree on the golden path. Proposal-first (per team decision 2026-02-21).
**Impact:** Blocks init-related code changes until Brady reviews the proposal.
- Kovash (REPL): Can call `parseCastResponse` + `createTeam` to wire up casting flow in shell dispatcher
- Verbal (Prompts): INIT_TEAM format is now the contract — coordinator prompt should emit this
- Hockney (Tests): cast.ts needs unit tests for parser edge cases, emoji mapping, file creation

### 2026-03-02: REPL empty-roster gate — dual check pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**What:** REPL dispatch is now gated on *populated* roster, not just team.md existence. `hasRosterEntries()` in `coordinator.ts` checks for table data rows in the `## Members` section. Two layers: `handleDispatch` blocks with user guidance, `buildCoordinatorPrompt` injects refusal prompt.
**Why:** After `squad init`, team.md exists but is empty. Coordinator received a "route to agents" prompt with no agents listed, causing silent generic AI behavior. Users never got told to cast their team.
**Convention:** Post-init message references "Copilot session" (works in VS Code, github.com, and Copilot CLI). The `/init` slash command provides same guidance inside REPL.
**Impact:** All agents — if you modify the `## Members` table format in team.md templates, update `hasRosterEntries()` to match.

### 2026-03-02: Connection promise dedup in SquadClient
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**What:** `SquadClient.connect()` now uses a promise dedup pattern — concurrent callers share the same in-flight `connectPromise` instead of throwing "Connection already in progress".
**Why:** Eager warm-up and auto-cast both call `createSession()` → `connect()` at REPL startup, racing on the connection. The throw crashed auto-cast every time.
**Impact:** `packages/squad-sdk/src/adapter/client.ts` only. No API surface change.

### 2026-03-01: CLI UI Polish PRD — Alpha Shipment Over Perfection
**By:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Context:** Team image review identified 20+ UX issues ranging from P0 blockers to P3 future polish

**What:** CLI UI polish follows pragmatic alpha shipment strategy: fix P0 blockers + P1 quick wins, defer grand redesign to post-alpha. 20 discrete issues created with clear priority tiers (P0/P1/P2/P3).

**Why:** Brady confirmed "alpha-level shipment acceptable — no grand redesign today." Team converged on 3 P0 blockers (blank screens, static spinner, missing alpha banner) that would embarrass us vs. 15+ polish items that can iterate post-ship.

**Trade-off:** Shipping with known layout quirks (input positioning, responsive tables) rather than blocking on 1-2 week TUI refactor. Users expect alpha rough edges IF we warn them upfront.

**Priority Rationale:**
- **P0 (must fix):** User-facing broken states — blank screens, no feedback, looks crashed
- **P1 (quick wins):** Accessibility (contrast), usability (copy clarity), visual hierarchy — high ROI, low effort
- **P2 (next sprint):** Layout architecture, responsive design — important but alpha-acceptable if missing
- **P3 (future):** Fixed bottom input, alt screen buffer, creative spinner — delightful but not blockers

**Architectural Implications:**
1. **Quick win discovered:** App.tsx overrides ThinkingIndicator's native rotation with static hints (~5 line fix)
2. **Debt acknowledged:** 3 separate separator implementations need consolidation (P2 work)
3. **Layout strategy:** Ink's layout model fights bottom-anchored input. Alt screen buffer is the real solution (P3 deferred).
4. **Issue granularity:** 20 discrete issues vs. 1 monolithic "fix UI" epic — enables parallel work by Cheritto (11 issues), Kovash (4), Redfoot (2), Fenster (1), Marquez (1 review)

**Success Gate:** "Brady says it doesn't embarrass us" — qualitative gate appropriate for alpha software. Quantitative gates: zero blank screens >500ms, contrast ≥4.5:1, spinner rotates every 3s.

**Impact:**
- **Team routing:** Clear ownership — Cheritto (TUI), Kovash (shell), Redfoot (design), Marquez (UX review)
- **Timeline transparency:** P0 (1-2 days) → P1 (2-3 days) → P2 (1 week) — alpha ship when P0+P1 done
- **Expectation management:** Out of Scope section explicitly lists grand redesign, advanced features, WCAG audit — prevents scope creep

### 2026-03-01: Cast confirmation required for freeform REPL casts
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Context:** P2 from Keaton's reliable-init-flow proposal

**What:** When a user types a freeform message in the REPL and the roster is empty, the cast proposal is shown and the user must confirm (y/yes) before team files are created. Auto-cast from .init-prompt and /init "prompt" skip confirmation since the user explicitly provided the prompt.

**Why:** Prevents garbage casts from vague or accidental first messages (e.g., "hello", "what can you do?"). Matches the squad.agent.md Init Mode pattern where confirmation is required before creating team files.

**Pattern:** pendingCastConfirmation state in shell/index.ts. handleDispatch intercepts y/n at the top before normal routing. inalizeCast() is the shared helper for both auto-confirmed and user-confirmed paths.

### 2026-03-01: Expose setProcessing on ShellApi
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Context:** Init auto-cast path bypassed App.tsx handleSubmit, so processing state was never set — spinner invisible during team casting.

**What:** ShellApi now exposes setProcessing(processing: boolean) so that any code path in index.ts that triggers async work outside of handleSubmit can properly bracket it with processing state. This enables ThinkingIndicator and InputPrompt spinner without duplicating React state management.

**Rule:** Any new async dispatch path in index.ts that bypasses handleSubmit **must** call shellApi.setProcessing(true) before the async work and shellApi.setProcessing(false) in a inally block covering all exit paths.

**Files Changed:**
- packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/components/App.tsx — added setProcessing to ShellApi interface + wired in onReady
- packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/index.ts — added setProcessing calls in handleInitCast (entry, pendingCastConfirmation return, finally block)

### 2026-03-01T20:13:16Z: User directives — UI polish and shipping priorities
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01

**What:**
1. Text box preference: bottom-aligned, squared off (like Copilot CLI / Claude CLI) — future work, not today
2. Alpha-level shipment acceptable for now — no grand UI redesign today
3. CLI must show "experimental, please file issues" banner
4. Spinner/wait messages should rotate every ~3 seconds — use codebase facts, project trivia, vulnerability info, or creative "-ing" words. Never just spin silently.
5. Use wait time to inform or entertain users

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory and crash recovery

### 2026-03-01T20:16:00Z: User directive — CLI timeout too low
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01

**What:** The CLI timeout is set too low — Brady tried using Squad CLI in this repo and it didn't work well. Timeout needs to be increased. Not urgent but should be captured as a CLI improvement opportunity.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory and PRD inclusion

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad Storage & Resolution Design
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** 
- New directory structure: ~/.config/squad/squads/{name}/.squad/ with ~/.config/squad/config.json for registry
- Keep 
esolveGlobalSquadPath() unchanged; add 
esolveNamedSquadPath(name?: string) and listPersonalSquads() on top
- Auto-migration: existing single personal squad moves to squads/default/ on first run
- Resolution priority: explicit (CLI flag) > project config > env var > git remote mapping > path mapping > default
- Global config.json schema: { version, defaultSquad, squads, mappings }

**Why:** 
- squads/ container avoids collisions with existing files at global root
- Backward-compatible: legacy layout detected and auto-migrated; existing code continues to work
- Clean separation: global config lives alongside squads, not inside any one squad
- Resolution chain enables flexible mapping without breaking existing workflows

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad SDK Functions
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**What:**
- New SDK exports: 
esolveNamedSquadPath(), listSquads(), createSquad(), deleteSquad(), switchSquad(), 
esolveSquadForProject()
- New type: SquadEntry { name, path, isDefault, createdAt }
- squads.json registry (separate file, not config.json) with squad metadata and mappings
- SquadDirConfig v2 addition: optional personalSquad?: string field (v1 configs unaffected)
- Consult mode updated: setupConsultMode(options?: { squad?: string }) with explicit selection or auto-resolution

**Why:**
- Lazy migration with fallback chain ensures zero breaking changes to existing users
- Separate squads.json is single source of truth for routing; keeps project config focused
- Version handling allows incremental adoption; v1 configs work unchanged
- SDK resolution functions can be called from CLI and library code without duplication

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad CLI Commands & REPL
**By:** Kovash (REPL)
**What:**
- New commands: squad list, squad create <name>, squad switch <name>, squad delete <name>
- Modified commands: squad consult --squad=<name>, squad extract --squad=<name>, squad init --global --name=<name>
- Interactive picker for squad selection: arrow keys (↑/↓), Enter to confirm, Ctrl+C to cancel
- REPL integration: /squad and /squads slash commands with 	riggerSquadReload signal
- .active file stores current active squad name (plain text)
- Status command enhanced to show active squad and squad list

**Why:**
- Picker only shows when needed (multiple squads) and TTY available; non-TTY gracefully uses active squad
- Slash commands follow existing pattern (/init, /agents, etc.); seamless REPL integration
- .active file is simple and atomic; suitable for concurrent CLI access
- Squad deletion safety: cannot delete active squad; requires confirmation

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad UX & Interaction Design
**By:** Marquez (UX Designer)
**What:**
- Visual indicator: current squad marked with ●, others with ○; non-default squads tagged [switched]
- Squad name always visible in REPL header and prompt: ◆ Squad (client-acme)
- Picker interactions: ↑/↓ navigate, Enter select, Esc/Ctrl+C cancel; 5-7 squads displayed, wrap around
- Error states: clear copy with next actions (e.g., "Squad not found. Try @squad:personal." or "Run /squads to list.")
- Copy style: active verbs (Create, Switch, List), human-readable nouns (no jargon), 3-5 words per line
- Onboarding: fresh install defaults to "personal"; existing single-squad users see migration notice

**Why:**
- Persistent context (squad name in header/prompt) prevents "Which squad am I in?" confusion
- Interactive picker is discoverable and non-blocking; minimal cognitive load
- Error messages with next actions reduce support friction
- Onboarding defaults and migration notices ensure smooth upgrade path for existing users

# Decision: Separator component is canonical for horizontal rules

**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Issues:** #655, #670, #671, #677

## What

- All horizontal separator lines in shell components must use the shared `Separator` component (`components/Separator.tsx`), not inline `box.h.repeat()` calls.
- The `Separator` component handles terminal capability detection, box-drawing character degradation, and width computation internally.
- Information hierarchy convention: **bold** for primary CTAs (commands, actions) > normal for content > **dim** for metadata (timestamps, status, hints).
- `flexGrow` should not be used on containers that may be empty — it creates dead space in Ink layouts.

## Why

Duplicated separator logic was found in 3 files (App.tsx, AgentPanel.tsx, MessageStream.tsx). Consolidation to a single component prevents drift and makes it trivial to change separator style globally. The info hierarchy and whitespace conventions ensure visual consistency as new components are added.

# Decision: CLI sessions use approve-all permission handler

**Date:** 2025-07-14
**Author:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Issue:** #651

## Context

The Copilot SDK requires an `onPermissionRequest` handler when creating sessions. This handler was defined in our adapter types (`SquadSessionConfig`) but was never wired in the CLI shell's 4 `createSession()` calls. External users hit a raw SDK error with no guidance.

## Decision

All CLI shell session creation calls now pass `onPermissionRequest: approveAllPermissions`, a handler that returns `{ kind: 'approved' }` for every request. The CLI runs locally with user trust — there is no interactive permission prompt.

SDK consumers (programmatic API users) still control their own handler. The SDK's `createSession` in `adapter/client.ts` now catches the raw permission error and wraps it with a clear message explaining how to fix it.

## Impact

- **CLI users:** Error is gone. All permissions auto-approved (matches existing CLI trust model).
- **SDK consumers:** Better error message if they forget to pass `onPermissionRequest`.
- **Types:** `SquadPermissionHandler`, `SquadPermissionRequest`, `SquadPermissionRequestResult` are now exported from `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/client` for reuse.

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad Global Config Layout
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)  
**Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Issue:** #652  
**PR:** #691  

## What

Squad now supports a global `squads.json` registry at the platform config root (`%APPDATA%/squad/` on Windows, `~/.config/squad/` on Linux/macOS). Each named squad is registered with a name, path, and creation timestamp. Resolution follows a 5-step chain: explicit name → `SQUAD_NAME` env var → active in squads.json → "default" → legacy `~/.squad` fallback.

## Why

Users need to manage multiple squads (personal, work, experiments) without conflicts. A global registry decouples squad identity from the current working directory and enables future CLI commands (`squad list`, `squad switch`, etc.) in Phase 2.

## Migration Strategy

Migration is **non-destructive and registration-only**. When `resolveSquadPath()` detects a legacy `~/.squad` layout without an existing `squads.json`, it registers that path as the "default" squad. No files are moved, copied, or renamed. This eliminates data loss risk on first upgrade.

## Impact

- All future squad path resolution should go through `resolveSquadPath()` from `multi-squad.ts`
- Existing `resolveSquad()` and `resolveSquadPaths()` in `resolution.ts` remain unchanged (project-local `.squad/` walk-up)
- Phase 2 CLI commands will consume these SDK functions directly

### 2026-03-01: PR #547 Remote Control Feature — Architectural Review
**By:** Fenster  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**PR:** #547 "Squad Remote Control - PTY mirror + devtunnel for phone access" by tamirdresher (external)

## Context

External contributor Tamir Dresher submitted a PR adding `squad start --tunnel` command to run Copilot in a PTY and mirror terminal output to phone/browser via WebSocket + Microsoft Dev Tunnels.

## Architectural Question

Is remote terminal access via devtunnel + PTY mirroring in scope for Squad v1 core?

## Technical Assessment

**What works:**
- RemoteBridge WebSocket server architecture is sound
- PTY mirroring approach is technically correct
- Session management dashboard is useful
- Security headers and CSP are present
- Test coverage exists (18 tests, though failing due to build issues)

**Critical blockers:**
1. **Build broken** — TypeScript errors in `start.ts`, all tests failing
2. **Command injection vulnerability** — `execFileSync` with string interpolation in `rc-tunnel.ts`
3. **Native dependency** — `node-pty` requires C++ compiler (install friction)
4. **Windows-only effectively** — hardcoded paths, devtunnel CLI Windows-centric
5. **No cross-platform strategy** — macOS/Linux support unclear

**Architectural concerns:**
1. **Not integrated with Squad runtime** — doesn't use EventBus, Coordinator, or agent orchestration. Isolated feature.
2. **Two separate modes** — PTY mode (`start.ts`) vs. ACP passthrough mode (`rc.ts`). Why both?
3. **New CLI paradigm** — "start" implies daemon/server, not interactive mirroring. Command naming collision risk.
4. **External dependency** — requires `devtunnel` CLI installed + authenticated. Not bundled, not auto-installed.
5. **Audit logs** — go to `~/.cli-tunnel/audit/` instead of `.squad/log/` (inconsistent with Squad state location).

## Recommendation

**Request Changes** — Do not merge until:
1. TypeScript build errors fixed
2. Command injection vulnerability patched (use array args, no interpolation)
3. Tests passing (currently 18/18 failing)
4. Cross-platform support documented or Windows-only label added
5. Architectural decision on scope: Is this core or plugin?

**If approved as core feature:**
- Extract to plugin first, prove value, then consider core integration
- Unify PTY vs. ACP modes (pick one)
- Integrate with EventBus/Coordinator (or explain why isolated is correct)
- Rename command to `squad remote` or `squad tunnel` (avoid `start` collision)
- Move audit logs to `.squad/log/`

**If approved as plugin:**
- This is the right path — keeps core small, proves value independently
- Still fix security issues before merge to plugin repo

## For Brady

You requested a runtime review. Here's the verdict:

- **Concept is cool** — phone access to Copilot is a real use case.
- **Implementation needs work** — build broken, security issues, Windows-only.
- **Architectural fit unclear** — not in any Squad v1 PRD. No integration with agent orchestration.
- **Native dependency risk** — `node-pty` adds install friction (C++ compiler required).

**My take:** This belongs in a plugin, not core. External contributor did solid work on the WebSocket bridge, but Squad v1 needs to ship agent orchestration first. Remote access is a nice-to-have, not a v1 must-have.

If you want this in v1, we need a proposal (docs/proposals/) first.

### 2026-03-02: Multi-squad test contract — squads.json schema
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Issue:** #652

## What

Tests for multi-squad (PR #690) encode a specific squads.json contract:

```typescript
interface SquadsJson {
  version: 1;
  defaultSquad: string;
  squads: Record<string, { description?: string; createdAt: string }>;
}
```

Squad name validation regex: `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,38}[a-z0-9])?$` (kebab-case, 1-40 chars).

## Why

Fenster's implementation should match this schema. If the schema changes, tests need updating. Recording so the team knows the contract is encoded in tests.

## Impact

Fenster: Align `multi-squad.ts` types with this schema, or flag if different — Hockney will adjust tests.

### 2026-03-02: PR #582 Review — Consult Mode Implementation
**By:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Context:** External contributor PR from James Sturtevant (jsturtevant)

## Decision

**Do not merge PR #582 in its current form.**

This is a planning document (PRD) masquerading as implementation. The PR contains:
- An excellent 854-line PRD for consult mode
- Test stubs for non-existent functions
- Zero actual implementation code
- A history entry claiming work is done (aspirational, not factual)

## Required Actions

1. **Extract PRD to proper location:**
   - Move `.squad/identity/prd-consult-mode.md` → `docs/proposals/consult-mode.md`
   - PRDs belong in proposals/, not identity/

2. **Close this PR with conversion label:**
   - Label: "converted-to-proposal"
   - Comment: Acknowledge excellent design work, explain missing implementation

3. **Create implementation issues from PRD phases:**
   - Phase 1: SDK changes (SquadDirConfig, resolution helpers)
   - Phase 2: CLI command implementation
   - Phase 3: Extraction workflow
   - Each phase: discrete PR with actual code + tests

4. **Architecture discussion needed before implementation:**
   - How does consult mode integrate with existing sharing/ module?
   - Session learnings vs agent history — conceptual model mismatch
   - Remote mode (teamRoot pointer) vs copy approach — PRD contradicts itself

## Architectural Guidance

**What's right:**
- `consult: true` flag in config.json ✅
- `.git/info/exclude` for git invisibility ✅
- `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` for worktree compatibility ✅
- Separate extraction command (`squad extract`) ✅
- License risk detection (copyleft) ✅

**What needs rethinking:**
- Reusing `sharing/` module (history split vs learnings extraction — different domains)
- PRD flip-flops between "copy squad" and "remote mode teamRoot pointer"
- No design for how learnings are structured or extracted
- Tests before code (cart before horse)

## Pattern Observed

James Sturtevant is a thoughtful contributor who understands the product vision. The PRD is coherent and well-structured. This connects to his #652 issue (Multiple Personal Squads) — consult mode is a stepping stone to multi-squad workflows.

**Recommendation:** Engage James in architecture discussion before he writes code. This feature has implications for the broader personal squad vision. Get alignment on:
1. Sharing module fit (or new consult module?)
2. Learnings structure and extraction strategy
3. Phase boundaries and deliverables

## Why This Matters

External contributors are engaging with Squad's architecture. We need to guide them toward shippable PRs, not just accept aspirational work. Setting clear expectations now builds trust and avoids wasted effort.

## Files Referenced

- `.squad/identity/prd-consult-mode.md` (PRD, should move)
- `test/consult.test.ts` (tests for non-existent code)
- `.squad/agents/fenster/history.md` (claims work done)
- `packages/squad-sdk/src/resolution.ts` (needs `consult` field, unchanged in PR)


### cli.js is now a thin ESM shim

**By:** Fenster  
**Date:** 2025-07  
**What:** `cli.js` at repo root is a 14-line shim that imports `./packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js`. It no longer contains bundled CLI code. The deprecation notice only displays when invoked via npm/npx.  
**Why:** The old bundled cli.js was stale and missing commands added after the monorepo migration (e.g., `aspire`). A shim ensures `node cli.js` always runs the latest built CLI.  
**Impact:** `node cli.js` now requires `npm run build` to have been run first (so `packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js` exists). This was already the case for any development workflow.
